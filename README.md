# **Serverless Email Marketing Project**  

This project provides a **serverless email marketing solution** using **AWS Lambda, S3, SES, EventBridge, and IAM**. It automates sending personalized emails to target users based on CSV data stored in **Amazon S3**.  

## **Project Overview**  
This project automates the email marketing process using a **serverless architecture**. By leveraging:  
- **AWS Lambda** for computation  
- **S3** for storage  
- **SES** for email sending  
- **EventBridge** for scheduling  

This ensures a **scalable and cost-effective** email marketing solution.  

## **Prerequisites**  
- âœ… **A validated email address** (must be from a domain)  
- âœ… **Basic AWS knowledge**  
- âœ… **A text editor** to edit HTML email templates (or use `email.html` provided in the repo)
